# GaloisFields
Prime and polynomial fields with coefficient field as either values from a prime or polynomial field.

Code is intended to be kept simple, based on Python lists.
Development has been done on my iPhone using Python2IDE (Python 2.7.14) and Python3IDE (Python 3.6.4).  The Python3IDE has an issue with not updating the display when an error occurs, making it kind of hard to debug there.

IntegerFunctions.py is a support program for the
test program.  The functions there are not intended to be the fastest or most efficient: phi, primeFactors.  Except for gcdex.
